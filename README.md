# TicketBooker: A Scalable Ticket Booking System with C# and Modern Tooling

## Selected Project
### Train Ticket booking Management System
In this project, we will create a ticketing application for local trains. Customers can look into the app to make reservations for local trains and acquire online booking receipts. Customers can print these receipts as proof for traveling. The app comprises two accounts, one Admin account, and the other being a user account. With the help of the Admin account, the Admin can view all the booked tickets of a user. While using the application, users have to fill a ticket booking form to make the reservation.

## Project Title
Our project title will be “TicketBooker: A Scalable Ticket Booking System with C# and Modern Tooling”.

To select a project title for our ticket booking system we first had to understand the requirements of the project and also ensure that the scope of the project covered the standard features of our selected programming language, which is C#. We also took into account that our project will cover the standard features of a programming language along with supportive tools and services like Database Management System, REST API support, FrontEnd visualization and Version Control Integration.

Based on these considerations, we propose the project title "TicketBooker: A Scalable Ticket Booking System with C# and Modern Tooling." This title conveys the main purpose of the project along with the inclusion of the programming language and the fact that we will be using supportive tools and services.

## Project Scope
### Features of the selected project
#### Account creation (sign up / registration)
Users should be able to create accounts and profiles within the app. This feature enables them to store their personal information, manage bookings, track ticket history, and receive personalized recommendations or notifications.

#### User and Admin login
The user/admin login feature of the ticket booking app provides a secure and personalized access point for both customers and administrators. After creating their accounts, users can log in and access various functionalities of the app. With the login feature, customers can view their booking history, manage reservations, and receive personalized recommendations. On the other hand, administrators can access an exclusive dashboard to manage train schedules, seating arrangements, and handle customer support.

#### Train search and Seat Selection
Users can search for available trains based on their desired departure and destination stations, along with the preferred date and time. The app will provide a list of train options along with relevant details like train names, departure and arrival times, durations, and ticket prices. For trains that offer different seating classes (e.g., economy, business, first class), the app should allow users to choose their preferred class and select specific seats if applicable. Users can select their preferred train and seat and proceed with the booking process.

#### Booking and Payment
Users can confirm their train booking by specifying the number of tickets they require and proceed to the payment stage. The app will support secure payment options such as credit cards, debit cards, net banking, or digital wallets to complete the transaction.

#### Ticket Management and E-Tickets 
Once the booking is confirmed, users will receive electronic tickets (e-tickets) that contain essential information such as train details, journey dates, seat numbers, and boarding instructions. The app will allow users to access and manage their tickets within the app, including the ability to view, cancel, or modify bookings.

#### Notifications and Reminders
The app can send notifications and reminders to users regarding upcoming events, ticket availability, seat upgrades, or any changes in event schedules. These notifications can be delivered via push notifications, email, or in-app messages.

### End Users

The end users of a train ticket reservation app may be from different groups of people who commute by train for various purposes. The potential end users for this project are described below:

- **General Public**: Individuals from the general population who travel by train for personal reasons, including workers, tourists, students, or people visiting friends and family. They use the app to search for available trains, book tickets, and manage their travel plans.

- **Business Travelers**: This category consists of the business men or business professionals who always commute for work and business, they rely on train services for their work and business trips. They use the app to buy train tickets, select desired seats and classes. Features such as the list of booked tickets, trip notifications, and convenient modification or cancellation of bookings are particularly useful to them.

- **Tourists**: Train trips are a typically popular choice for the travelers who visit a new city or country. They use the app to search and reserve the train tickets for sightseeing, visiting tourist spots, or traveling between destinations. Extra information can be added to the app to assist the tourist, for example, the station details, tourist guides, or local transportation options.

- **Students and Daily Commuters**: Students and daily commuters take trains for their regular transportations. They use the app to book their daily/weekly/monthly train tickets. It is crucial to provide this group of users with features like seat selection, season ticket options, ticket package options, and schedule notifications.

- **Senior Citizens and People with Disability**: Train journeys are usually preferred by the elderly and the disabled often because trains are more accessible and convenient to them. The app should provide features like user friendly interfaces, accessibility options, available seats with priority, or special request for assistance to handle their specific needs.

- **Group Travelers**: The app can provide the features such as group tickets booking, itinerary sharing, or group discounts to enhance the experience for friends, families, or groups traveling together by train. The app can allow them to book multiple tickets simultaneously, select seats to sit together, and coordinate their travel plans. 

The employees of the train company would also be end users of the train ticket booking app, but their role and interaction with the app would be different from the general public users. Here are some key employee roles and how they would benefit from the app:

- **Ticketing Staff**: Employees responsible for ticketing at train stations or customer service centers would use the app as a ticketing and booking tool. They would utilize features such as ticket issuance, reservation management, ticket printing, and handling customer inquiries or issues related to ticket bookings.

- **Train Operators and Conductors**: Train operators and conductors would rely on the app for accessing train schedules, route information, and passenger details. The app can provide real-time updates, seat occupancy status, and passenger manifests, allowing them to efficiently manage train operations and ensure smooth passenger experiences.

- **Customer Support Representatives**: Customer support representatives, either at train stations or call centers, would use the app to assist customers with queries, complaints, or ticketing issues. They would have access to customer profiles, booking histories, and ticket details, enabling them to provide personalized assistance and resolve customer concerns.

- **Management and Administration**: Employees at the managerial and administrative levels would use the app for monitoring and analyzing various aspects of the train service. They can access data and reports related to ticket sales, passenger trends, revenue, and operational performance. This information helps in decision-making, planning future strategies, and optimizing services.

- **Technical Support and IT Staff**: Technical support and IT employees would interact with the app from a maintenance and support perspective. They would monitor the app's performance, handle technical issues, ensure data security, and manage updates or enhancements to the app infrastructure.
